# Notes for future viewers
1.Fritzing File does not showcase arduinos used extensively in current version of project
2.Schematic for Arm Wiring is still pending
3. PWM cycling is used to control servos and motors, moreover servos listed/used in our project have been found to be overpowered for the current
usecase of the rover.
